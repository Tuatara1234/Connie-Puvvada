Hello, welcome to my data science project site. 

I am an aspiring data scientist loving everything data. 

I have had more than 20 years of professional experiences at IBM mainly on Business Partners support. While on the job, I discovered the power of data for business process analysis and efficiency improvements. The last two and a half years at IBM, I learned many data related skills including data ETL, SQL, and Business Intelligent dashboard. To expand my skills in using data to solve problems, I took a four-month full time data science immersive boot camp at General Assembly. Since then, I am happy ever after learning everything about data.

I am also in the process of acquiring knowlege in  deep learning & algorithmic trading.

This site contains some of the projects from the data science boot camp and additional projects after the class. 

As I continue to learn and understand more, I will update & correct my codes. 


Projects:

1) Sorghum Corp Yield Predictions
This is my data science capstone project. I always want to utilize data to solve social problems. World hunger is not an easy problem to solve. But I believe to acquire basic knowledge on crop yield productions is one small step closer in solving the problem. 

2) Data Science Job Market Analysis & Salary Ranges Predictions
It has been an exciting journey learning data science. It is time to look for my dream job. Approximately five thousands data science/data analyst jobs scraped from Indeed.com using BeautifulSoup. Detail exploratory data analysis was done on the dataset. Different classifiers were applied to make the predictions on the salary ranges based on cities and job titles. 
  
3) Bill or Neil?
I recently attended the Atlanta Women Who Code event utilizing machine learning for sentiment analysis. Our team is very proud of winning the 2nd place! We also presented our project at the Atlanta Startup Village in October, 2017. This project is to showcase a small part of my work analyzing my two favorite modern scientists Bill Nye and Neil deGrasse Tyson's tweets and make predictions. 

4) New Line of Clothing
Inspired by the simple yet powerful Central Limit Theorum and the fond memories of the garment factories, I want to combine both to answer a business question. 

5) Customer Segmentation
A simple project to demonstrate market segmentation using k-mean clustering unsupervised learning technique. 

I will continue to post more projects. 

Please feel free to explore and provide feedback. 

Have a good one!
