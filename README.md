Hello, welcome to my data science project site. 

I am an aspiring data scientist loving everything data. 

I have had more than 20 years of professional experiences at IBM mainly on Business Partners support. While on the job, I discovered the power of data for business process analysis and efficiency improvements. The last two and a half years at IBM, I learned many data related skills including data ETL, SQL, and Business Intelligent dashboard. To expand my skills in using data to solve problems, I took a four-month full time data science immersive boot camp at General Assembly. Since then, I am happy ever after learning everything data. 

This site contains some of the projects that I engaged during the boot camp and additional projects after the class. 

I am still struggling in some of the concepts. As I continue to learn and understand more, I will update & correct my codes. 

Please feel free to explore and provide feedback. 

Have a good one!

Connie Puvvada
